There are two epics:</p> <h2 id="ramayana">Ramayana</h2> <p>The Ramayana where Vishnu is reincarnated in as Rama and figths agaisnt the demon Ravana with the help of Hanuman, the monkey, to save his wife Sita.</p> <p>Atributed to Valmiki.</p> <h2 id="mahabharata">Mahabharata</h2> <p>The Mahabharata, considered to be longest epic poem ever written, where Vishnu is reincarnated as Krishna and the story is about the figth for power between the Kaurava and Pandava cousins.</p> <p>The most important book on Hindu philosophy and religion is part of the Mahabarata, it is called the Bhagavad-Gita “The Song of the Lord”, is where god -Krishna- reveals itself to Arjuna (Humanity), his companion, and reveals the thruth of existence.</p> <p>The famous phrase of Oppenheimer, “I´m become death, the destroyer of worlds” comes from this book.</p> <p>The Mahabharata is attributed to Viasa.</p> <h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2> <p>I always recommend reading the official original sources, but for us Hindu is so vast and strange that an introduction may help, and for this I recommend the books of Roberto Calasso:</p> <ul> <li>Ka</li> <li>El Cazador Celestial</li> <li>Ardor</li> </ul> <p>These books are hard too, but is an easier way to introduce yourself to this world. All of Hindu mythology is impregnated by its philosophy, you learn a lot reading it.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm-8 offset-sm-2 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/krishna-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/krishna-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/krishna-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/krishna.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Books"/><category term="mythology"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction to Hindu mythology books.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Listening to Brahms in Sala Nezahualcóyotl</title><link href="https://eduardogc21.github.io/blog/2024/listening-to-brahms-in-sala-nezahualcoyotl/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Listening to Brahms in Sala Nezahualcóyotl"/><published>2024-12-01T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-01T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://eduardogc21.github.io/blog/2024/listening-to-brahms-in-sala-nezahualcoyotl</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://eduardogc21.github.io/blog/2024/listening-to-brahms-in-sala-nezahualcoyotl/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="kavakos-playing-brahms">Kavakos playing Brahms</h1> <p>On saturday 30th November I went to Sala Nezahualcóyotl, this time the OFUNAM played alongside Sylvain Gasançon, principal conductor:</p> <p>Wagner</p> <ul> <li>Prelude and Death of Isolde</li> </ul> <p>Tchaikovsky</p> <ul> <li>Romeo and Juliet Fantasy-Overture</li> </ul> <p>Brahms</p> <ul> <li>Violin Concerto</li> <li>Leonidas Kavakos, violin, special guest</li> </ul> <p>A wonderful experience to see and hear Kavakos play, he even granted the audience with not one but two solo encores.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm-6 offset-sm-3 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/kavakos-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/kavakos-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/kavakos-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/kavakos.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Classical-Music"/><category term="music"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Musical experience]]></summary></entry></feed>
