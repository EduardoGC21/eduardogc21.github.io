Hello, my name is Eduardo Garcia Cortez, and I am 21 years old. I was born in Culiac√°n, Sinaloa. I am passionate about coding, classical music, literature, and philosophy. I enjoy cycling and staying active through regular exercise.

I am currently a Data Science student at ITAM in Mexico City, Mexico, with a strong foundation in Python and Java. I have hands-on experience with various programming tools and enjoy working on projects that blend data analysis with creative problem-solving.

I believe in the power of continuous learning and aim to merge my interests in technology and philosophy to solve meaningful problems.
