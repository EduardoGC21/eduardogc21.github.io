This project focuses on cleaning, normalizing, and analyzing fishing data from CONAPESCA for the years 2020-2022. It examines key metrics of Mexico's fishing industry, including species captured, monetary values, and regional specialization. Using SQL, the team corrected data inconsistencies, standardized formats, and normalized the dataset to the fourth normal form to ensure data integrity and scalability.

Key Highlights:

Data Scope: Over 630,000 records, covering monthly fishing activities across Mexican regions.

Normalization: Processed to eliminate redundancies and ensure accurate relational structures.

Insights:
- Aquaculture yields less in weight but more in value compared to capture fishing.
- Sinaloa dominates in monetary production, driven by shrimp exports.
- Sardines are the most captured species by weight, yet shrimp leads in revenue.
- Regional analyses highlighted cities with the highest economic contributions.
