This project was developed by myself and a friend Harry Gomar.

It consisted in designing and developing a videogame of the dialogue Crito from Plato.

Making it interactive and easier to learn. With decision branches and continuity in the arguments given along the whole dialogue.

You can try it <a href="https://experiencia-platon.vercel.app/">here</a>.

The hardest part was making the decision path and joining the arguments with responses without making it harder.

We used Twine to design the decision path.

And for development Angular.
