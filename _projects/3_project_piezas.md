We're working on a project to improve the reuse of auto parts. There's a lack of information that leads to many parts not being reused, which has a big environmental cost.

The goal is to support identifying part equivalents and adaptations to enable more reuse. We're using replicable processes like identification, connection, homogenization, and classification techniques.

We are collaborating with JETZapp to leverage industry knowledge and access part catalogs.

Some successful solutions for the data extraction from PDF catalogs have included Pandas functions and agent-based research.

Future plans include direct multimodal processing and automated categorization. 

By 2025, the project aims to enable the integration of used parts into the current market through strategies like part interchangeability, adaptability, and developing reuse models from other industries.
