# How to start on Hindu mythology
## Basics
Hindu mythology is one of the oldest and richest of the entire world, it started with oral tradition like all mythologies, imagine the aryan people chanting the hymns and making oblations to Brahma, Agni, Vishu and others in the Hindu valley, the only reamins we have of this culture are their texts, like Roberto Calasso mentions: they built a Parthenon of words, Sanskrit.

The writing of the Vedas started around 1700 BCE, the most important one, the Rig-Veda, is a series of hymns in the name of the gods, reading them you get a sense of the cosmovision they had.

The Upanishads are more on the philosophical side they were written around 600 BCE.


Then there are also the stories of the avatars of Vishnu, the Epics, which are more friendly, is like reading a epic of Homer, but longer. There are two epics:

## Ramayana

The Ramayana where Vishnu is reincarnated in as Rama and figths agaisnt the demon Ravana with the help of Hanuman, the monkey, to save his wife Sita.

Atributed to Valmiki.

## Mahabharata

The Mahabharata, considered to be longest epic poem ever written, where Vishnu is reincarnated as  Krishna and the story is about the figth for power between the Kaurava and Pandava cousins. 

The most important book on Hindu philosophy and religion is part of the Mahabarata, it is called the Bhagavad-Gita "The Song of the Lord", is where god -Krishna- reveals itself to Arjuna (Humanity), his companion, and reveals the thruth of existence.

The famous phrase of Oppenheimer, "IÂ´m become death, the destroyer of worlds" comes from this book.

The Mahabharata is attributed to Viasa.

## Recommendations
I always recommend reading the official original sources, but for us Hindu is so vast and strange that an introduction may help, and for this I recommend the books of Roberto Calasso:
- Ka
- El Cazador Celestial
- Ardor

These books are hard too, but is an easier way to introduce yourself to this world.
All of Hindu mythology is impregnated by its philosophy, you learn a lot reading it.
