# Sapolsky on why we don´t have free will

I´m currently reading Robert Sapolsky book, Determined: A Science of Life without Free Will.

He argues from a biological, neurological, cultural, historical, chemical point of view why we don´t have free will, which resonates with what philosophers like Schopenhauer or Spinoza claimed centuries ago. 

It is a deligth to read.
