# Kavakos playing Brahms

On saturday 30th November I went to Sala Nezahualcóyotl, this time the OFUNAM played alongside Sylvain Gasançon, principal conductor:

Wagner
- Prelude and Death of Isolde

Tchaikovsky
- Romeo and Juliet Fantasy-Overture

Brahms
- Violin Concerto
- Leonidas Kavakos, violin, special guest

A wonderful experience to see and hear Kavakos play, he even granted the audience with not one but two solo encores.
